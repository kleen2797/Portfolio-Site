            <img class="photo" src="assets/media/Kp1.jpg" alt="image of Ball and Beam System">
                <p class="description"> Prior to this project, I was familiar with the requirements of building a physical pendulum/lever system, as I had built 
                    several trebuchets in high school.  Unlike a trebuchet hoever, the fine tuning of the ball and beam system is the controls loop that wraps 
                    arduino system data, and the finetuning is done through matlab and analysis of data via excel and matlab analysis. </p>
            
            
            <h1 class="title">Project Scope</h1>
                <p class="description"> The purpose of this project is to use a cascaded control loop  to optimize a physical balancing beam and ball system.
                    Utilizing several controls engineering techniques in an iterative approach to improve the system, small improvements were met with analysis 
                    of resulting issues, and optimization. The control techniques progressively built up to a final system including optimizing plant parameters,
                    Pole-Zero compensation, Lead/Lag compensation, and a PID control loop.  </p>
                           
            
            <h1 class="title">Tuning System Parameters</h1>
                <p class="description"> Analyzing the system's closed loop step response allows for tuning motor characteristics before adding additional controls.
                    adjusting the value of Kp (proportional gain) for the system to minimise position overshoot and steady state error is a key  step to building a solid foundation
                    other controllers can be built around.  </p>
                <img class="photo" src="assets/media/Kp1.jpg" alt="graph readout showing affects of changing motor parameter Kp on the closed loop step response">
                <p class="caption"> Figure 5: System response graphs showing the effect of changing motor parameter Kp on the closed loop step response</p>
                <p class="description"> As can be seen in the graph comparisons above, adjusting the proportional gain Kp can have a large impact on the system's position overshoot 
                    steady state error.  Practically on the Ball and beam system, this looks like some pretty intense wobbling and overcorrection, in this case over a full second of Steady 
                    State wobble. Choosing proportional gain values proved to be tricky, as each value has pros and cons.  While the higher value of kp may produce a lower RMS error in the system,
                    when Feedforward and Pole Zero cancellation were added to the system it lost stability and resulted in a large amount of ringing. A key takeaway was to run many trials with each
                    parameter configuration to be able to reference as you progress.  Unorganized or unsaved data is not usable, and with a large number of datapoints to keep track of, ensures a 
                    re-do</p>
